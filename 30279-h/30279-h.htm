<h2 class="hide">Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> publishers suggested the bringing together of the three poems here
presented to the reader as being to some extent alike in their general
character. “The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay” is a perfectly intelligible
conception, whatever material difficulties it presents. It is
conceivable that a being of an order superior to humanity should so
understand the conditions of matter that he could construct a machine
which should go to pieces, if not into its constituent atoms, at a given
moment of the future. The mind may take a certain pleasure in this
picture of the impossible. The event follows as a logical consequence of
the presupposed condition of things.</p>

<p>There is a practical lesson to be got out of the story. Observation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>shows us in what point any particular mechanism is most likely to give
way. In a wagon, for instance, the weak point is where the axle enters
the hub or nave. When the wagon breaks down, three times out of four, I
think, it is at this point that the accident occurs. The workman should
see to it that this part should never give way; then find the next
vulnerable place, and so on, until he arrives logically at the perfect
result attained by the deacon.</p>


<p class="extraspace">Unquestionably there is something a little like extravagance in “How the
Old Horse won the Bet,” which taxes the credulity of experienced
horsemen. Still there have been a good many surprises in the history of
the turf and the trotting course.</p>

<p>The Godolphin Arabian was taken from ignoble drudgery to become the
patriarch of the English racing stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Dutchman was transferred from between the shafts of a cart to
become a champion of the American trotters in his time.</p>

<p>“Old Blue,” a famous Boston horse of the early decades of this century,
was said to trot a mile in less than three minutes, but I do not find
any exact record of his achievements.</p>

<p>Those who have followed the history of the American trotting horse are
aware of the wonderful development of speed attained in these last
years. The lowest time as yet recorded is by Maud S. in 2.08&frac34;.</p>


<p class="extraspace">If there are any anachronisms or other inaccuracies in this story, the
reader will please to remember that the narrator’s memory is liable to
be at fault, and if the event recorded interests him, will not worry
over any little slips or stumbles.</p>


<p class="extraspace">The terrible witchcraft drama of 1692 has been seriously treated, as it
well deserves to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> The story has been told in two large volumes by
the Rev. Charles Wentworth Upham, and in a small and more succinct
volume, based upon his work, by his daughter-in-law, Caroline E. Upham.</p>

<p>The delusion commonly spoken of, as if it belonged to Salem, was more
widely diffused through the towns of Essex County. Looking upon it as a
pitiful and long dead and buried superstition, I trust my poem will no
more offend the good people of Essex County than Tam O’Shanter worries
the honest folk of Ayrshire.</p>

<p>The localities referred to are those with which I am familiar in my
drives about Essex County.</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="smcap">Have</span> you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay,<br />
That was built in such a logical way<br />
It ran a hundred years to a day,<br />
And then, of a sudden, it&mdash;ah, but stay,<br />
I’ll tell you what happened without delay,<br />
Scaring the parson into fits,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Frightening people out of their wits,&mdash;<br />
Have you ever heard of that, I say?</p>

<p class="poem">Seventeen hundred and fifty-five,<br />
<i>Georgius Secundus</i> was then alive,&mdash;<br />
Snuffy old drone from the German hive;<br />
That was the year when Lisbon-town<br />
Saw the earth open and gulp her down,<br />
And Braddock’s army was done so brown,<br />
Left without a scalp to its crown.<br />
It was on the terrible earthquake-day<br />
That the Deacon finished the one-hoss-shay.</p>

<p class="poem">Now in building of chaises, I tell you what,<br />
There is always <i>somewhere</i> a weakest spot,&mdash;<br />
In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,<br />

He would build one shay to beat the taown<br />

As if he dragged a coach of state;<br />
He’s not a colt; he knows full well<br />

No horse so sturdy but he fears<br />
The handicap of twenty years.<br />

The old horse nears the judges’ stand,<br />
Beneath his jockey’s feather-weight<br />
He warms a little to his gait,<br />
And now and then a step is tried<br />
That hints of something like a stride.</p>

<p class="poem">He led the hags to a railway train<br />
The horses were trying to drag in vain.<br />
“Now, then,” says he, “you’ve had your fun,<br />
And here are the cars you’ve got to run.<br />
The driver may just unhitch his team,<br />
We don’t want horses, we don’t want steam<br />
You may keep your old black cats to hug,<br />
But the loaded train you’ve got to lug.”</p>

<p class="poem">Since then on many a car you’ll see<br />
A broomstick plain as plain can be;<br />
On every stick there’s a witch astride,&mdash;<br />
The string you see to her leg is tied.<br />
She will do a mischief if she can,<br />
But the string is held by a careful man,<br />
And whenever the evil-minded witch<br />
Would cut some caper, he gives a twitch.</p>

<p class="poem">As for the hag, you can’t see her,<br />
But hark! you can hear her black cat’s purr,<br />
And now and then, as a car goes by,<br />
You may catch a gleam from her wicked eye.</p>

<p class="poem">Often you’ve looked on a rushing train,<br />
But just what moved it was not so plain.<br />
It couldn’t be those wires above,<br />
For they could neither pull nor shove;<br />
Where was the motor that made it go<br />
You couldn’t guess, <i>but now you know</i>.</p>
